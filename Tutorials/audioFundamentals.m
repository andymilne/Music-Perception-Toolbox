% This tutorial shows how to estimate the weights of all possible
% fundamentals (virtual pitches) of every member of a set of audio files.
% (See audRoughHarmEntropy for how the vector of fundamental weights
% calculated here can be used to calculate the harmonicity of the audio
% files.)

    % Extract peaks from smoothed log-f spectra, where smoothing has
    % standard deviation sigma. Narrower smoothing (smaller sigma) allows
    % for closer spectral peaks to be separately resolved (partials
    % differing by about 2 * sigma + 1 cents will be separately resolved as
    % peaks). However, if the smoothing is too narrow, a single pitch with
    % some vibrato will, unhelpfully, be resolved as multiple separate
    % peaks. Hence a compromise is necessary. By eye, sigma of about 9 or
    % 12 cents typically look optimal. Also return the log-f spectrum.
