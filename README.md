# Music-Perception-Toolbox

A MATLAB toolbox dedicated to the analysis and modelling of musical patterns such as scales, chords, tonality, rhythms, and meter.

Many of the functions require the [Sparse Array Toolbox](https://github.com/andymilne/Sparse-Array-Toolbox).

This work forms part of an Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (project number DE170100353) funded by the Australian Government.
