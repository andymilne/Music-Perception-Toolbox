# Music Perception Toolbox

A MATLAB toolbox dedicated to analysing musical patterns -- such as scales, chords, tonality, rhythms, and meter â€“ and modelling perception and cognition of these patterns.

Many of the functions require the [Sparse Array Toolbox](https://github.com/andymilne/Sparse-Array-Toolbox).

This work forms part of an Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (project number DE170100353) funded by the Australian Government.
